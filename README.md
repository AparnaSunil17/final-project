With the rapid growth of digital communication, smishing—SMS-based phishing—has emerged as a critical cybersecurity threat, tricking users into divulging sensitive information through deceptive messages. The main objective of this project is to propose a smishing detection system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and ensemble learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability by analyzing both the textual and URL content present in SMS. The proposed system employs DistilBERT, a transformer-based model, to analyze the textual content of messages and identify patterns associated with smishing attempts. Simultaneously, AdaBoost with Extra Trees (ABET) is utilized for URL-based phishing detection, extracting key features from embedded links to assess their legitimacy. Unlike traditional black-box approaches, the study also incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for text classification, providing insights into the most influential words contributing to a model’s decision. This enhances transparency, enabling users and security analysts to understand why a message is classified as smishing. The models operate independently, ensuring a modular and adaptable detection framework. Performance evaluations on a labeled dataset demonstrate high classification accuracy, with the combined model achieving 98.13%, DistilBERT achieving 99.73% for text-based classification, and ABET achieving 92.66% for URL-based phishing detection. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with explainability, this work highlights the importance of interpretable AI in cybersecurity. The findings provide valuable insights into how phishing tactics evolve and how AI-driven models can mitigate emerging threats, making the proposed approach a significant step toward more secure SMS communication.
